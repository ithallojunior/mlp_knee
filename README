# Introduction
This projects presents a MLP ANN that aproximates angular velocities from a human knee. 
Specifically it gets contralateral knee data and simulates the angular volocity of the knee.

The software was written in gnu octave language version 4.0.

## Use
Into the mlp directory from this project, run gnu ocatve. From octave command line run: Run_this_mlp()
